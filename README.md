# Discussion-Exercises-Naive-Bayes
Below are some practice exercises to supplement the lecture on Bayesian models. Use this discussion to discuss your findings, pose questions, and help each other expand your understanding of probabilistic classification. Feel free to post other exercises but please limit this discussion to only analytics covered so far.

Create a function (naiveBayesA) that accepts two data frames, one for training and one for testing. Using the e1071 naive bayes function, train the model to classify the training set on the first column. Return the accuracy of the model.
Following the same requirements as #1, do the same for a function called naiveBayesB. Use the naive bayes function from naivebayes library. Return the accuracy of the model.
Is there a significant difference between the two functions naiveBayesA and naiveBayesB? Use iris, diamonds, and mtcars for your testing.
